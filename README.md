## 🧠 The Concept

Generate a weighted maze. Throw 5 algorithms at it. Watch them compete. Analyze who wins and *why*.

Data Maze Pro turns algorithm comparison into a game — complete with scoring, achievements, and a full analytics dashboard. It's pathfinding meets data science.

## 🧮 The Competitors

| Algorithm | Strategy | Finds Optimal? |
|-----------|----------|:--------------:|
| **Dijkstra** | Explores everything, misses nothing | ✅ |
| **A*** | Smart heuristic + guaranteed optimal | ✅ |
| **BFS** | Breadth-first, ignores terrain costs | ❌ |
| **Greedy** | Fastest to finish, not always the best path | ❌ |
| **Bidirectional** | Attacks from both ends simultaneously | ❌ |
